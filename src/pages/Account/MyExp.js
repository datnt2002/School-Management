                would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.
                To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar,
                pronunciation and more common words.</p>

            <p class="para text-muted mt-2 mb-0 pb-3">If several languages coalesce, the grammar
                of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of
                the individual languages. The new common language will be more
                simple and regular than the existing European languages.</p>
